            <!-- you structure this -->
                <p>I enjoy going to the gym and lifting weights and getting stronger
                    while doing so. I like doing compound lifts seeing my progress on how
                    heavy I can go on the compound lifts. My favorite compound lifts include
                    bench press, deadlift, and cleans.

            <!-- you structure this -->
                <p>Moutain climbing is one of the outdoors activities that I have gotten into
                    recently and have really enjoyed and getting better in. I have mainly climbed
                    indoors on fake walls but really would like to go outdoor climbing more. <br/>
                    I can climb up to a 5.9 difficulty right now and can almost climb some 5.10 routes.
